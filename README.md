# Work Day Scheduler 2022

# Features Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap. Moment.js

# Brief Description

For this task I modified a started code to create a simple calendar application which allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

# User Story

When using the daily planner to create a schedule you will see the current date displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll you will be able to see the time slots for standard business hours. Each time slot is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey, present (red) or future (green). When you click on a time slot you are able to enter an event and save it, this will then be stored in the local storage and you are able to view this even after the page has refreshed.
